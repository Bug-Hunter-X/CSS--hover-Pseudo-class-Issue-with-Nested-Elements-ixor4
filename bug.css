The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class is not working as intended.  The text within the `<p>` tag should change color when the `<div>` element is hovered over, but it does not.

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

div:hover p {
  color: red;
}

p {
  color: blue;
}
```

```html
<div>
  <p>This text should turn red on hover.</p>
</div>
```
